# passman
Password generator script

This script is a complex password generator that allows for saving results to a text file for secure local storage. 

It only accepts absolute paths. 

The overwrite function checks if you have a text file with the same name at the chosen path and gives you the option to name the password again
or overwrite the previous version saved. This helps when implementing a password change to a commonly used site, no need to hold onto old passwords.

Password length is set to 15 characters.
